#### ML_Supervisor uses natural language processing algorithms to search for and classify content of interest. 

ML_Supervisor was designed so that the user does not need to code or have any prior knowledge of Machine learning(ML) algorithms before using the tool.

The ML_Supervisor graphic user interface is currently configured as follows:

1. Test area: allows a user to input any sentences or content of interest to assess the latest memory and accuracy of the        models.

2. Train area: risk staff can manually accelerate and manage the learning rate of the models.

3. Target area: allows the user to point the models wherever they wish. Models are currently pointing and searching for          content of interest at an email server.
