#### ML_Supervisor uses natural language processing algorithms to search for and classify content of interest. The interface allows the user to train and test the algorithms to look for any content of interest. 

The ML Supervisor graphic user interface is currently configured as follows:

1. Test area: allows a user to input any sentences or content of interest to assess the latest memory and accuracy of the        models.

2. Train area: risk staff can accelerate and manage the learning rate of the models.

3. Target area: allows the user to point the models wherever they wish. Models are currently pointing and searching for          content of interest at an email server of interest.
