#### ML_Supervisor uses natural language processing algorithms to search for and classify content of interest. The interface allows the user to train and test the algorithms to look for any content of interest. 

ML Supervisor interface is currently configured as follows:

1. Test area to allow a user to input any sentences or content of interest to assess the latest memory and accuracy of the        models.

2. Train area to assist with the models learning rate.

3. Target area to allow user to point the models wherever they wish. Models are currently pointing and searching for content      of interest at an email server of interest.
